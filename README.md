# Project Express API

This project was about building an API using Express and was my very first introduction to backend.

## The problem

Tech & Tools used:

- RESTful API
- Postman
- JavaScript
- Node.js

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
